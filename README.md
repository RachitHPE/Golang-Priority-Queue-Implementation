# Golang-Priority-Queue-Implementation

This repo used package "container/heap" to implement the functionality of priority queue in golang.

Use case taken in this repo:

The user will input the list of food items along with its expiryInDays(days in which food gets expired). 

The pop operation of priority queue will give the element that gets expired first. Here expiryInDays is set as priority key in priority queue
